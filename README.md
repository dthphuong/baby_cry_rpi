# Baby cry detection - Deployment on Raspberry Pi

Recognition of baby cry from audio signal.

The aim is to automatically recognize a baby crying while sleeping. In such case, a lullaby is started to calm the baby
down.

This is done by implementing a machine learning algorithm on a Raspberry Pi.

### Hardware setup

+ Raspberry Pi 2B or 3 (I haven't tried it yet on Zero, the connections being a bit different, it might need some additional setup)
+ Usb microphone
+ Speakers connected via Jack 3.5 mm

### Software setup

This repo should be cloned on the Rapsberry Pi in `/opt/`.

To make it work:

+ Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/) on your Raspberry Pi
+ Get the Docker image `docker pull mikkl/rpi-raspbian-baby-cry-detection:pi2`
+ Put `model.pkl` generated by [baby_cry_detection](https://github.com/giulbia/baby_cry_detection) in folder
 `model`
+ Put the _egg_ file `baby_cry_detection-x.x-py2.7.egg`
generated by [baby_cry_detection](https://github.com/giulbia/baby_cry_detection) in folder `lib`
+ Execute `script/run.sh` from `/opt/baby_cry_rpi`


For Raspberry Pi 3, replace tag: from `pi2` to `latest` (in script `run.sh` as well)
